Use exact calibration/raking procedure as used in ESS. Change NA procedure. They allocate/copy NAs in control proportion as well.

From ESS post-stratification weighting document:

"Missing value only in sample cell. Values in missing cells are copied to corresponding
cells in control data table, taking the missing at random assumption (MAR). Next,
other cells in the control data table are proportionally adjusted so that the total
sum and the ratio between existing cells are preserved.""
